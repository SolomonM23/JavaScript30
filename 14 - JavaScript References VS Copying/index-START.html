      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); //if you don't pass anything, it copies the whole array

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      team4[4] = "Solo";

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[4] = "Jimminey Crickett";
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      const captain = person;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      //pass empty obj, pass original obj, pass new key/value pair you want to add to new array
      console.log(cap2);
      // We now have the object ...spread - like array ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const solo = {
        name: "Solo",
        age: 175,

        },
      };

      console.log(solo);

      //making a copy does not effect original
      const hot = Object.assign({}, solo);

      //Object.assign only goes 1 level deep
      //if you make a change to an object inside the object on the copy, it will change on the original also

      hot.social.facebook = "Big Stepper";

      //poor man's deep clone object/array
      const tooHot = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(solo));
      //stringify turns the orig obj to a string, then parse turns it back to an object
      console.log(tooHot);

      //look into performance impact before using poor mans deep clone
